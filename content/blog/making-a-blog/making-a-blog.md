This is a rant. You should really skip it.

Haven't made a blog for a long time, but it seems I can't really tip-toe around it forever.

In an ideal world, there would be platforms out there where one can push content, and it would live there forever, hosted, searchable, ad-free.

However, enshittification is happening on every platform, so that just doesn't exist.

For the macflim annoucement, I actually wrote all the HTML by hand, as I didn't find any blogging platform that met my requirements at the time.

However, I have since started quite a few additional projects, and while creating a specific HTML file for each could be fun, maintaining it seem impossible. For instance, the macflim webpage is now out-of-date, and I am not looking forward adding information to it.

## My requirements

My set of hard requirements is pretty simple:

- I want to be able to create simple pages that render correctly on all devices
- I want no need for the end user to have javascript enabled
- I want no adverstising or tracking
- I want to be able to host it myself, because I don't really trust platforms
- I want reasonable control on the layout of the output
- I want the content to be available to me and everyone in an open fashion

There are additional softer requirements:

- I'd like to have the content stored in a public github and publish via commit
- I'd like to have a version of the website accessible to vintge web browser (ie: no https, simple formating)

Anyway, all this meant using a static web site generator, and hosting the resulting files myself. I did spent some time looking at various generators, but nothing seemed to be close to what I want. I did think about writing mine, as the layout I need is pretty trivial, but [we all know how it goes](https://xkcd.com/974/)

As my need are simple, any generator should work. So I pickedup 11ty, even if I absolutely despise javascript, nodejs and npm (those are, to me, the epithom of everything that went wrong with computing, the kingdom of "a peu pres". Those days, most things almost work, but most don't fully work).

## It almost work

To give an example of what "almost work" means, let's see how I can add an image to a page.

I can use

```
{ % image "path/to/image.png", "Image Title"}
```

*(Well, actually I can't I had to add a space betwee ``{`` and ``%``, because if I don't the templating engine interprets this as a command...)

However, I just want to specify a hard-coded size for the image display. Well, here is the [documentation of the "image plugin"](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/#creating-an-shortcode). I didn't want something complicated. I didn't want to know about the internal of the javascript. I just wanted to specify a size.

The third paragram says *Easily add width and height attributes on \<img> elements for proper aspect ratio mapping.*. Go one, scroll, and find the way to *easily add width and height* from the image tag. There is none. The onyl thing you'll find is some ``"(min-width: 30em) 50vw, 100vw"``, which, of course doesn't not work:

```
[11ty] 1. Having trouble rendering njk template ./content/blog/Making a Blog/Making a Blog.md (via TemplateContentRenderError)
[11ty] 2. (./content/blog/Making a Blog/Making a Blog.md)
[11ty]   EleventyShortcodeError: Error with Nunjucks shortcode `image` (via Template render error)
[11ty] 3. widths.map is not a function (via Template render error)
```

And this is supposed to be the leanest, simplest, website generator... And as things rarely go better in the web world, I see a lot of pain in my future...

## Parsing code blocks

While writing this rant, I didn't realise that the templating engine would parse the ``%image`` inside the code block, so it failed and just arbitrarily truncated the content

{% image "img/11ty-truncate.png", "Image Title" %}

## Restarting the server

Oh, did I mention that the development experience is awesome, as the 11ty command runs in the background and magically updates the webpage whenever I type something? I could sarcastically say that the workflow of writing a text page with tokens and have the rendered version update gives an experience close to using WordStar in 1983, but it is cool anyway.

But it doesn't fully work of course. Renaming a page will break the server work until I restart it. Almost works...

## Animated gifs...

So, I needed to embeded animated gifs. The fantastic ``image`` plugin supports animated gif, in the sense that it doesn't crash, and generates an image of the first frame of the gif.

Crawling the web, I discovered that I should add:

```js
				sharpOptions: {
				  animated: true
				}
```

to some code to have it handle animated gifs.

I looked at the most logical place and added that:

```js
		let metadata = await eleventyImage(file, {
			widths: widths || ["auto"],
			formats,
			outputDir: path.join(eleventyConfig.dir.output, "img"), // Advanced usage note: `eleventyConfig.dir` works here because weâ€™re using addPlugin.
			sharpOptions: {
				animated: true
			}
		});
```

This was the result, I kid you not:

{% image "img/11ty-animated-gif.png", "An animated gif, according to 11ty..." %}

I am not surprised, but the awfulness of modern frameworks never fails to disapoint me...

So I guessed that was because the image plugin didn't output animated gif by default, and I added gif to the list of supported outputs. Which didn't work until I removied all the other formats

I then got the marvelous:

{% image "img/11ty-animated-gif-2.png", "We go the animation working!" %}

And, yes, it was animated.
